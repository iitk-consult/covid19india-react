# ICG - WHO South Asia Office Dashboard

[IITK Consulting Group](http://www.iitkconsult.org/) is based out of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, where it works on applying artificial intelligence techniques to create social impact. We work with non-profits and social organisations and help them leverage better insights from their data.

We created this dashboard for the World Health Organisation (WHO) South Asia Office, where they aim to understand about the social media trends about covid-19 and the situation of hospitals. Currently this dashboard supports three countries: India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

## Acknowledgement

We have built upon [covid19india](https://github.com/covid19india)'s amazing work, and even used their API for our dashboard. They are a group of awesome volunteers who took upon themselves the herculean task of managing the information from multiple sources and presenting it.
